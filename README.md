# Simulating Evolution Using Neural Networks in Rust

Combining rust and neural networks to create something cool(hopefully)

## Thought Process

The idea is to create a simulated world with animals and food where each animal is able to go and gather food with a brain and specific vision which helps them determine which food they can get

### Steps

We can model brains as something that takes in information to produce certain outputs, or F(information) = actions
